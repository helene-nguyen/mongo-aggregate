# Let's go to Mongopark !

## Introduction

MongoDB with NodeJS Express and EJS engine for views.

## Updates to do before launch the code

Once you fill the database, there are some updates to do with the fields.

You'll see some $f1/$f2/$f3 fields, but I've changed before doing refactoring.

```js
$f1 = "event"
$f2 = "visitor"
$f3 = "timestamp"
```
## Initialization

First of all :

```js
npm init
```

and to add all of the npm packages :

```js
npm i
```

Don't forget to add you `.env` file !

## Import data

If you have MongoDB and you are learning how to use it, you'll find in this repo datas to import it.

Don't know how to do it ? 

No problem, you'll find a step by step [here](./__docs__/steps.md) !

## What will you find here ?

I've learnt to use MongoDB end the files without the .refacto was the code we had.

I just add some comments and refactor everything to make it more clear.

There is no style, just some html made with EJS engine to render a result (Oh my god, it seems that I'm more a back-end developper now ... )

Hope you'll enjoy it ! If you need, contact me :)
